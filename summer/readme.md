# Summer work

* Boolean types and semantic subtyping for Featherweight Java.
* Artem Usov
* 2296905u
* Ornela Dardha

## Research completed

Read main journal in the project, "Semantic Subtyping for Objects and Classes". 
Started on reading "Featherweight Java paper".
Found example of creating a [JVM Language](https://github.com/JakubDziworski/Enkel-JVM-language) using antlr to use as initial guidance. 

## Ideas developed

Decided on developing language from scratch rather than modifying existing java compiler.
Created template github repo using Github Actions CI, using Gradle as build tool, with 
Checkstyle, PMD and Spotbugs integrated into the build process as static analysis tools.

During internship, identified example of depedency injection where semantic subtyping could make
programming easier.

## Concerns or risks identified

Unsure of any/how much modification there will have to be the JVM to enable structural subtyping to work.
