## Winter break

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13**
* Write background of dissertation - Known mathematical background - Research more on current existing implementations

* **Week 14**
* Chapter 1 - Discussion on Featherweight Java and choice of using JVM for code generation, initial design and implementation of the language without semantic subtyping.
  
* **Week 15**
* Chapter 2 - The class based types and subtyping relation - mostly information from Semantic Subtyping paper (possibly swap chapters 1 and 2)

* **Week 16**
* Chapter 3 - Describe the implementation of subtyping in the final language, the algorithm and design chosen. 

* **Week 17**
* Chapter 4 - Discuss the computational efficiency of type checking and compilation, Discuss the expresivity power of the new type system in terms of examples which make expressing ideas more logical.

* **Week 19**
* Chapter 5 - Human evaluation of the language in terms of survey feedback, and possibly with quantitative data. Contrast the language against existing features in different languages and how useful the boolean connectives end up being. 

* **Week 20**
* Chapter 6 - Write introduction and conclusion

* **Week 21**
* Chapter 7 - Write future work, personal reflections and abstract 

* **Week 22**
* Review and editing of dissertation

* **Week 23 [TERM ENDS]**
* Finalise reviewing of dissertation, create the presentation.

* **Week 24** Dissertation submission deadline and presentations.
