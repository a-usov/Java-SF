# Advisor Meeting 15/10/2019

## Done
* From last week - contextual analysis completed, now added some extra checks like circular inheritence checking and that all fields are initialised
* Started on code generation
* Started more indepth reading

## Questions from last week addressed 
* Objects are constructed using expressions as arguments
* Void type is an internal construct, not in the language. 
* Added checks so all fields initialised
* Empty Set class type not added yet, but is not necessary until connective types implemented

## To be done
* Add checking for recursive field definitions, add support for a null type later so we can have recursive objects eg trees
* Add support for literals of type other than Int
* Finish code generation - ~20 hours work estimated
* Continue reading to prepare for start of work on semantic subtyping 

## Questions
* Type checking that takes into consideration inheritance (field assignment, method return type), probably not usefull to work on since it's going to be replaced when adding semantic type system?
* Should language use subset of Java basic types, for example only int, float, char, bool, void?
* Similarly add support for String being an integrated type? 
* Similarly add support for arrays/lists or do afterwards

## Minutes
* Array types could be likely integrated into a set based typing system.
* Restrict amount of basic types, keep track of additional language additions but implement after core of the project
* Continue reading and at the same time do literature reviews for self-help and to use during dissertation writing.
