# Advisor Meeting 02/10/2019

## Done

* Added project template to repo, set up local build and CI for dissertation.
* Completed initial grammar
* Started on contextual analysis with good design pattern
* Completed contextual analysis for fields, constructor and their subnodes, left to do methods and expressions

## To be done

* Finish contextual analysis and code generation  ~20 hours work left

## Questions

* mathematical expressions as expressions?
* compilation of multiple files?
* java-like need of not needing forward declarations?
* add in additional features now or later? eg multiple parameter methods vs singular

## Minutes

* add bool, void type
* methods should be able to be declared and used in any order
* most other features that are orthogonal to showing the semantic features of the language, implement them after the core of the project is finished, then add any features that make the language easier to use or more expressive.
* No need right now to start on dissertation - discussed the evaluation in the dissertation, should be both a technical evaluation but also an evaluation by people on how easy it is to use, how useful the core features are etc.
* Evaluation would be easier to conduct with a web interface that has an editor and compiler/interpreter for the language. 

### Tasks identified
* Investigate in the paper why there are only single parameter methods?
* Keep reading the relevant papers
